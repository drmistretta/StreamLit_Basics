st.markdown("""
Streamlit was founded in 2018 by Adrien Treuille, Amanda Kelly, and Thiago Teixeira, with public momentum growing in 2019. 
On March 2, 2022, the company was acquired by Snowflake, though it continues as an open-source Python framework that enables 
developers to transform scripts into interactive web applications with minimal boilerplate. For educators, Streamlit is 
especially valuable for rapidly prototyping classroom tools such as dashboards, simulations, and machine learning 
demonstrations without the need for extensive front-end development.

- **Official Gallery:** Hundreds of public apps across ML, education, data viz, and science.  
  - https://streamlit.io/gallery
- **Case studies (production/internal):**
  - **Delta Dental** (decision support): https://blog.streamlit.io/how-delta-dental-uses-streamlit-to-make-lightning-fast-decisions/
  - **Open Insurance (Snowflake story)** (self-service data apps): https://www.snowflake.com/en/customers/all-customers/case-study/open-insurance/

*Teaching tip:* For K–12 PD, pick 2–3 gallery apps aligned to your cohort (e.g., image classification demos, classroom analytics) and walk through the code → widget → rerun cycle.

st.header("3) Client side: laptops, tablets, and phones")
st.markdown("""
When you use Streamlit on a laptop, tablet, or phone, it works through the web browser. The browser is the “client,”
which means it shows the app’s visuals. The Python code, however, runs somewhere else (on the “server”). Whenever you
move a slider, click a button, or change a widget, the app’s code is re-run on the server and the updated results are
sent back to your browser almost instantly. Streamlit supports the latest versions of browsers like Chrome, Firefox,
Edge, and Safari. The layout is designed to be **responsive**, meaning it automatically changes how the information is
arranged and displayed based on the size and type of device you are using. This makes Streamlit work well on mobile
devices, though very wide tables or charts may still need small adjustments to display neatly.

st.header("4) Server/host side: rendering for all devices")
st.markdown("""
The “server” is the computer that actually runs your Streamlit app’s Python code. Think of it as the engine behind the
scenes. Every time a user interacts with the app, the server re-runs the script from top to bottom, quickly updates
the results, and then sends those updates back to the client (the user’s browser). To make apps faster, Streamlit uses
**caching**, which means it can remember the results of expensive calculations or data loading so it doesn’t have to
repeat the same work every time. This setup makes it possible for many people on different devices—laptops, tablets,
or phones—to use the same app at once. You can run the server on your own computer for testing, or host it in the
cloud (like Streamlit Community Cloud or Snowflake) so anyone with the link can access it.

- Put your code in a public GitHub repo with `requirements.txt`.
- On **Streamlit Community Cloud**, connect your GitHub, pick the repo/branch, and set the **main file path** (e.g., `streamlit_app.py`).
